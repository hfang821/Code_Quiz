## Description:

* This website is designed to help students to test their knowledge of entry level CSS, HTML and JavaScript using a set of multiple choice questions.
* This project was completed based on the JavaScript Web API concepts, producing an interactive experience on the Quiz Website.
* I have learned the tools & skills necessary to design a interactive website that can store the user's performance in the localStorage which does not vanish even the browser is closed. 


## Built By:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScipt Web API
